Creating the entire code for an IoT-based hotel and restaurant sales, purchase, order, and inventory management system is a complex task that involves multiple components, including hardware integration, cloud services, and software development. Designing such a system would require a team of developers, IoT specialists, and hardware engineers working together.

While I can't generate the entire code for such a comprehensive system here, I can provide an outline of how you might approach this using general pseudocode for some components. Keep in mind that the actual implementation would depend on your specific technology stack and IoT platform.

*Inventory Management Pseudocode:*
python
# Define a function to monitor inventory levels
def monitor_inventory():
    # Use IoT sensors to track inventory levels in real-time
    # Check for low stock or expired items
    # Trigger alerts or automatically place purchase orders based on thresholds

# Set up a function to receive alerts from inventory sensors
def inventory_alert_handler(alert):
    # Send alerts to relevant stakeholders or trigger automated purchasing

# Define functions for purchasing and restocking inventory
def place_purchase_order(item, quantity):
    # Use an integrated purchasing system to place orders with suppliers

def restock_inventory(item, quantity):
    # Update inventory levels after new stock arrives


*Sales and Purchase Integration Pseudocode:*
python
# Implement a function to update inventory levels after a sale
def update_inventory_after_sale(sold_item, quantity):
    # Deduct the sold items from the inventory

# Define a function to automate purchase orders
def automate_purchase_orders():
    # Check inventory levels and automatically place orders when necessary


*Order Management Pseudocode:*
python
# Set up a function to handle incoming orders from customers
def receive_customer_order(order):
    # Process the order and send it to the appropriate station (e.g., kitchen, bar)

# Implement a method to update the status of orders in real-time
def update_order_status(order_id, status):
    # Update the order status in the system
